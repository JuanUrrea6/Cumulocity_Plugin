# Time-Frequency Analysis
Development of a code capable of not only identifying the relevant frequencies of a given input signal, but the time intervals when those frequencies are presented. The entire coding development will be done using Python 3.4, with the possibility of incorporating other languages if required, first in notebooks, then in a fully functional script.

## Using **Analyzer**
Once the script has been downloaded, run it on the command line giving a *.txt* file as parameter.
```
python Analyzer.py data.txt
```
The file *data.txt* must contain the data that will be analyzed organized in a single column, no delimiters of any kind used.
