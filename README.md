**Data Solver** is a Matlab-based GUI app which allows users to do different kinds of data processing to numerical sets of data uploaded as file inputs. Itś main objective is to simplify the usrś task avoiding the direct use of the Matlab console and coding, providing a user friendly interface to control the process.

* **Requirements**
To run **Data Solver** all the files that compose it must be downloaded and executed using Matlab 2014a or newer.

* **Getting Started**
To begin using **Data Solver**, run the mainWindow.m file in the Matlab console. That's all. Any help needed with a particular function of the app will be provided in the **Help** menu.

While the app is being developed, no guarantee of it correct working is granted. It remains free to use for anyone who may need or want to use it, as long as it's referenced to its original author.
