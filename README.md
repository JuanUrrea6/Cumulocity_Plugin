# Time-Frequency Analysis
Development of a code capable of not only identifying the relevant frequencies of a given input signal, but the time intervals when those frequencies are presented. The entire coding development will be done using Python 3.4, with the possibility of incorporating other languages if required, first in notebooks, then in a fully functional script.
